        "The history of Christianity in Eritrea and the wider Horn of Africa begins at the intersection of scripture, classical geography, and later historical development. While the institutional establishment of Christianity in the region can be securely dated to the fourth century CE, earlier literary and ecclesiastical traditions suggest that northeastern Africa was not entirely outside early Christian awareness.",
        "The earliest textual reference appears in the **Acts of the Apostles (Acts 8:26–40)**, recounting the baptism of a high-ranking court official, described as a eunuch serving Candace, queen of the Ethiopians.¹ The precise geographic origin of this official remains debated."

        "Later ecclesiastical traditions attribute missionary activity in \"Ethiopia\" to apostles such as **Matthew** and, in some accounts, **Matthias**.³ These claims, lacking contemporary verification, reflect **theological memory rather than strict historical documentation**.⁴"

His inscriptions, in Greek, Geʿez, and South Arabian script, provide clear evidence for the Christianization of the Aksumite state.⁵",
        "Military campaigns against the declining Meroitic kingdom of Kush allowed Ezana to adopt the title **\"King of the Ethiopians,\"** giving Aithiopia a more localized, political meaning encompassing modern Eritrea and northern Ethiopia.⁶"

Historical evidence shows:",
        "**Abune Libanos became a monk** in the late 5th century and ministered in the southern highlands of Eritrea. He is credited with **translating parts of the Gospel of Matthew into Geʿez** and spreading monastic life in Werk' Ham and Guna-Guna Enda Meskel monasteries."

        "**Abune Libanos exemplifies the early monastic and scholarly tradition** that preserved the Tewaḥdo faith in Eritrea before the arrival of the Nine Saints.⁸ His work established the foundation for the monastic culture that would become central to Eritrean Orthodox identity."
